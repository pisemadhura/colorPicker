#Beginner React.js Projects

Hey  there! I am learning Facebookâ€™s React! These are the projects I have built along the way. I will be updating the projects as I discover new and more efficient techniques. 

#About the build directory
build/ directory holds `react.min.js` and `JSXTransformer.js` required files.

Some of these Projects are inspired by Egghead.io's React tutorials that I am going through. 

#If you want to clone
If you would like to clone and try out some of the projects on your machine, make sure you test the examples in a browser that allows corss origin file lookups like Firefox. Or you can run a simple HTTP server and test these in any browser.
